\chapter{Limitations}
\label{chapter6}
\thispagestyle{empty}

The main limitations of our work are:
\begin{itemize}
\item we do not handle packers that decrypt part of the code and after the execution re-encrypt it
\item we do not handle spawning of new processes, dropping of new malware, downloading and executing of new binaries, DLL injection 
\item if there is an IAT obfuscation technique that we can not handle we still produce a dump, but it will not be runnable
\item the packers do not write and execute directly on the stack
\item there are not relative calls in the heap section, because we dump the heap and create a new section with the stuff discovered in it without patching any call to a relative address 
\item the binary analysed is a 32 bit binary
\end{itemize}
