\section{System architecture}
Our tool is entirely based on PIN, a binary instrumentation framework developed by Intel. It lets us to have the instruction-level granularity useful to track memory writes on a finer grain. In this way we are able, for example, to see where a single assembly write instruction is going to write and consequently create the write sets.\\
We have integrated Scylla, an external open source program, to dump the code and reconstruct the IAT. Moreover we have extended it in order to deal with \textit{IAT Redirection} and \textit{Stolen API} techniques.\\
Finally we use the IDA Pro disassembler and an IDAPython script in the \textit{Init function calls} heuristic. The script calls IDA which reads the imports of the dump and compare them to a list of functions commonly used by the malware and not by the packer (registry manipulation, internet communication).
