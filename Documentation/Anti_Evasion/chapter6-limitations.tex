\paragraph{}
The principal limitations of out work are:
\begin{itemize}
\item we handle anti-evasion in our tool based on the work in \textit{eXait}, so if the reconstructed binary contains other evasion routines, like \textit{sleep} or \textit{isDebuggerPresent}, these are not patched. 
\item  if the stub implements an unknown technique that detects PIN, the analysis will fail. We justify this assumption due to the fact that few malware/packers implement evasion against PIN and we patch only the ones we are aware of.
\item the binary analysed is a 32 bit binary
\end{itemize}
